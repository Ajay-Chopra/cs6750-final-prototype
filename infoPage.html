    <h4>How Article Scores are Calculated</h4>
    <h5>Accuracy</h5>
    <p>
        An article's Accuracy score is determined by the percentage of its statements that are truthful.
        For instance, if an article makes 10 claims and 8 of the claims are true, then the article will
        have an accuracy score of 80%
    </p>
    <h5>Sources</h5>
    <p>
        An article's Sources score is determined by the percentage of its claims that contain cited sources
        and the accuracy scores of each of those sources. Hence, the sources must be cited and must be reliable
        in order for an article to attain a high sources score.
    </p>
    <h5>Human Written</h5>
    <p>
        The Human Written score is the percentage liklihood that the article was written by a human as opposed
        to generative AI. Our models are trained on millions of examples of both human written and AI written articles
        and can distinguish between them with >95% accuracy.
